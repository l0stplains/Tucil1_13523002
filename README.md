## Project Overview

<p align="justify">IQ Puzzler Pro is a logic-based puzzle game where the goal is to fill the entire board using a set of uniquely shaped pieces. Each piece can be rotated and flipped, making the search for a valid arrangement quite challenging. The game tests problem-solving skills, as all pieces must fit perfectly without overlap.</p>
<p align="justify">This project is a Brute Force solver for IQ Puzzler Pro, written in Java. It systematically tries all possible ways to place the pieces until it finds a solution or determines that no solution exists. To make the experience more engaging, I also designed a kawaii-styled GUI, which was a fun challenge on its own!</p>
